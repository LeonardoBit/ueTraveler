    <string name="welcome_message2">Good job with unlocking needed cells!
        Now you can connect to one of them. To do that you need to choose suitable cell and attach.
        Which one is suitable? That one you will be CAPABLE to handle as a UE.

    <string name="welcome_message3">You will be communicating with network by scanning NFC tags in different places.
        To start scanning press "Start scanning".
        Scanning will stop automatically after tag will be scanned.
